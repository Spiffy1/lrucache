This is a O(1) Python LRU cache implementation with the primary focus on performance.
If you've got an idea how to get it better. Feel free to mail me vburenin @at gmail.com

See tests for usage example. In basic cases the cache behaves like a dictionary, but there
are no methods like keys(), itervalues() etc. For the basic use cases it is just enough.
